You won't need to understand any font terminology to use this tool because the fonts are categorized visually.

Visual categories are more exact than terminology. For example, the terms “serif” and “sans-serif” are ambiguous because many fonts blend the visual characteristics of both.

Filter the font list with the buttons at the far left. By default, the list shows one font-weight per family, but you can expand the weights for more filters. Star fonts to compare them more easily. Tap the name of any font for more information.

The list includes only fonts that are freely available from Google.
